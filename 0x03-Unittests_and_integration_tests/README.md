# 📌 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on writing **unit tests** and **integration tests** in Python.  
You will learn how to properly test code, use mocks, and ensure reliability in software systems.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- ✅ The difference between **unit tests** and **integration tests**
- ✅ How to use the **`unittest`** module
- ✅ What **mocking** is and how to apply it
- ✅ How to **parameterize tests**
- ✅ How to use **fixtures** for setup and teardown
