# Python Generators - 0x00

This project sets up a MySQL database (`ALX_prodev`) with a table `user_data` and seeds it with data from a CSV file.  
It also introduces the use of Python generators for streaming rows from the database one by one.

## Files
- **seed.py**: Contains functions to connect to MySQL, create database/table, and insert data.
- **0-main.py**: Main script to run the setup and verify the database.
- **user_data.csv**: Sample user data for seeding the database.
